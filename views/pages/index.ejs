        <p>
          We gets thousands of submissions every year for artists interesting in participating in
          the CAC exhibits, and selects approximately 2k distinct pieces of contemporary art for
          display in their collective exhibit. In addition, 12 individuals are honored as Featured
          Artists - each being granted his or her own exhibit hall to display entire collections or
          themed pieces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each Featured Artist has an opportunity to speak at one of our and share his or her
          vision, perspective, and techniques with attendees on a more personal level than at our
          large conference. It is truly an honor to be a CAC Featured Artist and many past students
          artists who were featured at CAC have gone on to brilliant careers in art.
